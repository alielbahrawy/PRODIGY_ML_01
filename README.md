# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This is my submission for the **Machine Learning Task 1** in the PRODIGY internship program.  
In this project, I developed a simple linear regression model to predict stock closing prices based on historical data using Python and scikit-learn.

## ðŸ“Š Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict a stock's closing price based on the previous day's closing price.

### Steps Followed:
1. Loaded and explored the stock price dataset.
2. Visualized the relationship between features.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Trained a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - RÂ² Score
6. Visualized the results using matplotlib.
